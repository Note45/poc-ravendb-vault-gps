# RavenDB Vault GRPS

This project is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** built with **.NET**, aiming to demonstrate the application of the **Event Sourcing** pattern using **RavenDB** as the database.  

The PoC explores concepts such as event persistence, state rehydration, and query projections (read models), showing how RavenDB can be leveraged as an **Event Store** in distributed applications.

---

## üöÄ Goals

- Validate the use of **RavenDB** as an event store.  
- Demonstrate how to implement **Event Sourcing** in .NET.  
- Simulate write and read operations based on events.  
- Provide a starting point for applications adopting **event-driven architectures**.  

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The PoC follows the principles of **CQRS + Event Sourcing**:

- **Command Side (Write Model)**: handles commands and generates events that describe state changes.  
- **Event Store (RavenDB)**: stores all events immutably.  
- **Projections (Read Model)**: built by applying events to provide optimized queries.

## üîß Tech Stack

- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)  
- [RavenDB](https://ravendb.net/) (Event Store and Projections)  
- **gRPC** (service communication)  
- **CQRS + Event Sourcing**  

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 9+ SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)  
- [RavenDB](https://ravendb.net/downloads) running locally (can be via Docker).  

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Note45/poc-ravendb-vault-gps.git
   cd ravendb-vault-grps
```

2. Create base vault-gps in RavenDB

3. Configure the RavenDB connection string in appsettings.json.

4. Run the project:

```bash 
  dotnet run --project Vault.Gps/Vault.Gps.csproj 
```

5. The RavenDB Vault GRPS API will be available at:
